## Overview



The task is to implement a file replicator in Python that continuously replicates one directory from a source machine onto another directory on a target machine. When any changes occur in the source directory, the file replicator is responsible for replicating the change on the destination directory. While the replicators are copying, nothing else will modify the source or target directories.



The replicator is represented by two objects: a ReplicatorSource and ReplicatorTarget. Each object is able to access its respective directory. They communicate with each other using an RPC-style protocol. If you’re unfamiliar with RPCs, you can think of this as a client (ReplicatorSource) being able to call a function that runs on a server (ReplicatorTarget).



In this problem specifically, the ReplicatorSource can call its self._rpc_handle function which corresponds to calling the handle_request method on the ReplicatorTarget. You are expected to define both the request and response types. Both must be pickleable Python objects (to approximate the ReplicatorSource and ReplicatorTarget running on separate machines). Data composed of Python primitives like lists, dictionaries, strings, etc. are generally pickleable.



On both ends, the replicator is able to access the file system through a simplified interface (see file_system.py). You may also find it helpful to use some path utilities from posixpath (docs link to os.path) including posixpath.join, posixpath.basename, posixpath.dirname, and posixpath.relpath. These behave like os.path but work on Windows as well. Note that you shouldn’t use any os.path functions that actually access the file system like os.exists, etc. since the tests use a mock file system.



The ReplicatorSource is also able to ask the file system to watch for changes to a directory by passing in a callback that will be called for file system events on that directory. This should be done by calling self._fs.watchdir(dir_path, self.handle_event). Watching a directory consumes a valuable system resource, so these watches should be removed once they are no longer needed by calling self._fs.unwatchdir(dir_path).



For each watched directory, three kinds of file system events will be reported:

File or subdirectory added
File or subdirectory removed
File modified
Note that these file system events will only be reported for immediate children of the watched directory.



The target directory may start out with or without existing contents. In either case, it should be synced so that it exactly matches the source directory. Try to minimize the number of file writes on the target directory and the amount of data sent in the RPCs (see tasks 4 and 5 below).



Source and target directory equality will be checked after initialization and after each FileSystemEvent trigger.



To help debug, you can use the FileSystem.debug_string method to get a string representation of a subtree of the file system (including the directory structure and file contents).



## Running and Testing Your Code



If it's more convenient, you can copy and paste the contents of the files to use in a local IDE. Feel free to ignore the warning about copying and pasting code.



We provide a test suite to test your code in remote_file_replicator_test.py. Locally, you can run the entire test suite by running ./test.sh. It’s also possible to run a single test case by running ./test.sh TestRemoteFileReplicator.<test_name> (e.g. ./test.sh TestRemoteFileReplicator.test_initial_sync). In the online interface, you don't have control over the run command. Instead, you can increment the value for TASK_NUM in remote_file_replicator.py to activate more tests as you progress.



## Tasks



The problem is broken down into incremental tasks to achieve the above requirements. Make sure to read all the way to the end before you begin.

Implement the replicators to do the initial synchronization on initialization. Assume the target directory starts empty.
This corresponds to test cases test_initial_sync and test_unrelated_dirs.
Add directory watching so that updates to the source directory get synced to the target directory. Make sure to unwatch directories when no longer needed.
This corresponds to test cases test_watch_dirs and test_unwatch_dirs.
Handle the case where the target directory starts non-empty. In this case, after initialization the source and target directories should match exactly.
This corresponds to test case test_non_empty_target_dir.
Minimize file writes by ensuring that existing files in the target directory that exactly match the corresponding file within the source directory are not written to (either deleted and recreated or overwritten with the same content).
This corresponds to test case test_avoid_redundant_writes.
At this point you should also be able to pass test case test_all which tests all the above conditions at once.
Consider the case where files are very large. Reduce the amount of data sent in the RPCs by ensuring that full file content is only sent when necessary.
The test cases do not explicitly test for this but we will go over your solution to see how you addressed this.


You should only need to modify remote_file_replicator.py in the locations marked by # TODO (as well as adding any other helper methods / classes, etc. as needed) and will only need to use the interfaces defined in file_system.py. Feel free to add logging / other debugging information in other places but you should not modify the functionality of any code outside of remote_file_replicator.py.
